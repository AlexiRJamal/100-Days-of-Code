# 100 Days of Code
This README file does nothing, just a way to navigate and note some stuff.
  - Started keeping at day 24 (today)
  - Some stuff are missing
  - No consistency
  - I hate myself
# What is this?
This is just a way to motivate myself into doing something I was really good at, but unfortunately, due to lack of practice, now I'm 
not. I started forgetting a lot of stuff, maybe this will help.
# Missing days
You can check them on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/loox37/status/1284715390774509569?s=20).
# What's in this challenge?
Nothing much. Failed attempts at React.js (Fuck Mark and Facebook), and some attempts to regain my strength at backend, just as data 
structures, sorting algorithms, and more.
# Navigation
This table sums it up
